### 1_Endnote to BibTeX

```
endnote2bibtex.py
```

This code/GUI is to repair the unusable bibtex keys (RN+number) exported directly from Endnote. The keys after repairs follow similar rules as the ones exported from Google Scholar (firstauthorlastname+year+firstwordintitle).

Example:

`My EndNote Library.txt` is the raw output exported from Endnote. 

`MyEndNoteLibrary.bib` is the repaired output.
